# DeepSequence Recommender

DeepSequence Recommender is a sequence-aware recommendation service built around a FastAPI application, a modular sequence-processing pipeline, and Prometheus-compatible instrumentation.

This repository is designed to demonstrate production-style ML service design rather than a notebook-only recommender prototype.

---

## Overview

This project focuses on the engineering side of recommendation systems:

- serving recommendations through an API
- separating routing, preprocessing, configuration, and modeling concerns
- exposing service-level metrics for observability
- supporting local development, container execution, and Kubernetes deployment
- providing a cleaner foundation for future benchmarking and model evolution

Instead of presenting recommendation logic only in notebooks, this repo frames the work as a runnable service.

---

## What is implemented today

The current repository includes:

- a FastAPI service entry point
- startup-time model and processor initialization
- sequence preprocessing and vocabulary handling
- recommendation API routing
- Prometheus metrics exposure through `/metrics`
- Docker and Kubernetes deployment assets
- automated tests and CI wiring referenced from the repository root

This means a reviewer can inspect the repo as an application, not just a model artifact.
